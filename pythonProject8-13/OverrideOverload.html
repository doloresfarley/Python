    <h1>Operator Overloading vs Operator Overriding</h1>
    <p>
        In programming, <strong>operator overloading</strong> is used instead of
        <strong>operator overriding</strong> because when you overload an operator, you are
        essentially defining a new behavior for that operator specifically for a user-defined type,
        while still keeping the same operator symbol. Overriding would imply changing the behavior
        of an existing operator for a derived class in an inheritance hierarchy, which is not the
        case with operator overloading; you are essentially creating a new, distinct implementation
        for the operator based on the type of operands involved.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Points to Remember:</h2>
    <h3>Overloading:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Multiple definitions for the same operator, each with different parameter types,
            allowing the operator to work with different data types.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overriding:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Changing the implementation of an inherited method in a derived class, where the method
            signature remains the same.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine creating a class called <code>Complex</code> to represent complex numbers. You can
        overload the "+" operator to define how to add two complex numbers, essentially giving the
        "+" operator a new meaning for your <code>Complex</code> class. However, you are not
        overriding the existing "+" operator for other data types.
